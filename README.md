There is no limitation in the use of this software other than the following:  If you're using my code, original or modificated,
you are obliged to show somewhere "based on Cubecomps.com by Luis J. Iáñez".  If your page shows credits, I must appear
on them.

I estimate that only 70-80% of my original idea is already implemented.  If you're considering to derivate my code, maybe
you should wait a bit.
